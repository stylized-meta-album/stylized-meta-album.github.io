    "long_description" : "OmniPrint-MD-mix dataset consists of 28 240 images (128x128, RGB) from 706 categories. The images are synthesized with OmniPrint [32], and no further processing was done. The OmniPrint synthesis parameters are stated as follows: font size is 192, image size is 128, the strength of random perspective transformation is 0.04, left/right/top/bottom margins are all 20% of the image size, the strength of pre-rasterization elastic transformation is 0.035, random translation is activated both horizontally and vertically, rotation is within −60 and 60 degrees, horizontal shear is within −0.5 and 0.5, brightness is within 0.8333 and 1.2, contrast is within 0.8333 and 1.2, color enhancement is within 0.8333 and 1.2. The other parameters vary between images. We designed 20 settings, each setting is used to synthesize 2 images. All images/textures consists of photos taken by a personal mobile phone.",
