    "long_description" : "The PlantDoc dataset(https://github.com/pratikkayal/PlantDoc-Dataset) is made up of images of leaves of healthy and unhealthy plants. The images were downloaded from Google Images and Ecosia, and later cropped by the authors, so generally, one complete leaf fits in one image. The original, uncropped images are generally different in scale, light conditions, and pose. However, within one category, images of leaves that came from the same original image can be found. The images correspond to 27 classes, including plant disease names and plant species names, e.g.: Corn Leaf Blight and Cherry Leaf respectively. The dataset was created for a benchmarking classification model work, published in 2020 by Singh et al. The PlantDoc dataset in the Meta-Album benchmark is extracted from a preprocessed version of the original PlantDoc dataset. First, to get i.i.d. samples, only one leaf image per each original image is randomly picked. Then, leaves images are cropped and made into squared images which are then resized into 128x128 with anti-aliasing filter.",
