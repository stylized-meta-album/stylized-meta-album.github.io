    "long_description" : "The original Animals with Attributes 2 (AWA) dataset (https://cvml.ist.ac.at/AwA2/) was designed to benchmark transfer- learning algorithms, in particular attribute base classification and zero-shot learning. It has more than 37 000 images from 50 animals, where each animal corresponds to a class. The images of this dataset were collected from public sources, such as Flickr, in 2016, considering only images licensed for free use and redistribution. Each class can have 100 to 1 645 images with a resolution from 100x100 to 1 893x1 920 px. To preprocess this dataset, we cropped the images from either side to make them square. In case an image has a resolution lower than 128 px, the squared images are done by either duplicating the top and bottom-most 3 rows or the left and right most 3 columns based on the orientation of the original image. Lastly, the square images are resized into 128x128 px using an anti-aliasing filter.",
