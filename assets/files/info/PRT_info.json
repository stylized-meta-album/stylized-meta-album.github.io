    "long_description" : "This dataset is a subset of the Subcellular dataset in the Protein Atlas project(https://www.proteinatlas.org/). The original dataset, which stems from the Human Protein Atlas Image Classification Kaggle competition(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/human-protein-atlas-image-classification), comprises 31 072 RGBY images of size 512x512 px, each of which belongs to one or more out of 28 classes. The labels correspond to protein organelle localizations. For Meta-Album, we performed two modifications: (1), to turn the dataset into a multi-class dataset, we dropped all images belonging to more than a single class and also those images that belong to classes with less than 40 members; (2) we converted the remaining images into RGB simply by dropping the yellow channel; this was also a common practice in the competition. Finally, and as for all datasets in Meta-Album, the images from the original dataset were resized to 128x128 image size.",
